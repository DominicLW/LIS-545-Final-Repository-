# LIS-545-Final-Repository-
Files Within the Repository: 
  1) Dataset: The Dataset folder contains all of the .WAV files available within the main dataset used within the creators experiments that have been edited down. The naming conventions follow the pattern C_NNNNN_BB_SS_OOOOO_RXX, which has to be exploded as follows:

C = emission context (values: B = brushing; F = waiting for food; I: isolation in an unfamiliar environment);
NNNNN = cat’s unique ID;
BB = breed (values: MC = Maine Coon; EU: European Shorthair);
SS = sex (values: FI = female, intact; FN: female, neutered; MI: male, intact; MN: male, neutered);
OOOOO = cat owner’s unique ID;
R = recording session (values: 1, 2 or 3)
XX = vocalization counter (values: 01..99)

  2) Additional_Data: The Additional Data folder contains the extra sounds that were recorded during the experiments not utilized by the creators because they were not necessarily meows or were uncut sequences of close vocalizations. They are named still using similar naming conventions as the files in the Dataset folder and are still in a .WAV file format.
  3) CatMeows_Metadata: This is an XML file that is formatted using the DataCite metadata standards and outlines the relevant metadata about the CatMeows dataset within this repository.
  4) Final Repository Report: This document is the full report on both the selected dataset, CatMeows, and the suggested repository, Macualay Library. Both of these reports have been combined into one singular report seperated into seperate sections describing the dataset and the repository. Additonally, this file contains links within the document that connect users to the original dataset published on Zenodo and the repository website.
  5) Additional Information(Repository): This document provides additional information and speculations about the document that may be useful to think about when considering issues of preservation, citation, copyright, and human subjects.
